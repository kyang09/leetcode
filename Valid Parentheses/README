From LeetCode's "Valid Parentheses":

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.

My solution:
    Runtime: 42 ms
    Runtime beats 76.49 % of python submissions.
